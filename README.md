# Pathfinding Visualization

This project is a web application for visualizing various pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, A Star, Dijkstra, and Greedy Best First Search. It allows users to select a start and end tile, add walls to the tile map, and visualize how the pathfinding algorithms find the shortest path from start to end. Users can also create random mazes using depth first search backtracking and set random tilemaps with varying ratios of walls to open tiles.

## Pathfinding Algorithms

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It starts at the root node and explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth. This algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path if it exists, but it can be slow and memory-intensive for large graphs.

* Time complexity: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
* Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

### Depth First Search (DFS)

DFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph, but in depth-first order. It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Unlike BFS, DFS is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, but it can be faster and use less memory than BFS for certain graphs.

* Time complexity: O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
* Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

### Dijkstra

Dijkstra is a shortest path algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It works by assigning tentative distances to all nodes and then iteratively selecting the node with the smallest tentative distance and updating the distances of its neighbors. Dijkstra's algorithm is guaranteed to find the shortest path if all edge weights are non-negative, but it can be slow and memory-intensive for large graphs.

* Time complexity: O((V+E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
* Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

### A Star

A Star is a heuristic search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to an end node in a weighted graph. It works by using a heuristic function to estimate the distance from each node to the end node and combining this with the actual distance from the start node to calculate a priority for each node. A Star uses a priority queue to select the next node to explore and updates the distances of its neighbors based on the priority. A Star with a Euclidean heuristic function uses the straight-line distance between nodes as the estimate, while A Star with a Manhattan heuristic function uses the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates.

* Time complexity: O(E log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
* Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

### Greedy Best First Search

Greedy Best First Search is a heuristic search algorithm that prioritizes exploring nodes that are closest to the end node in a weighted graph. It works by using a heuristic function to estimate the distance from each node to the end node and selecting the node with the smallest estimate as the next node to explore. Greedy Best First Search can be faster than A Star, but it is not guaranteed to find the shortest path and may get stuck in local optima.

* Time complexity: O(E log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
* Space complexity: O(V), where V is the number of vertices

# Sorting Visualization

This project is a web application for visualizing various sorting algorithms such as Linear, Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Bogo. It allows users to change the number of bars to sort and the sorting speed, and then visualize how the algorithms sort the bars.

## How to use
Follow the link: https://btschneid.github.io/Pathfinding-and-Sorting-Visualizer/sorting.html OR click the Pathfinding Visualizer button on the bottom right of the Pathfinding Visualizer page

1. Change the number of bars to sort using the slider.
2. Change the sorting speed using the speed slider.
3. Click on any of the sorting algorithm buttons to visualize how they work.
4. Mute the sound if it is too overbearing.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Linear

Linear sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the input array and finding the minimum element, then swapping it with the first element. It then iterates through the remaining elements and finds the minimum of those, swapping it with the second element, and so on.

* Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Bubble

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It continues to do this until no more swaps are needed.

* Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Selection

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by finding the minimum element in the input array and swapping it with the first element. It then finds the minimum element of the remaining elements and swaps it with the second element, and so on.

* Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Insertion

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iterating through the input array and inserting each element into its proper place in a sorted subarray. It does this by comparing each element with the previous elements in the subarray and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

* Time complexity: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Merge

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by recursively dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

* Time complexity: O(n log n)
* Space complexity: O(n)

### Quick

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array into two subarrays based on the pivot, and then recursively sorting the two subarrays.

* Time complexity: O(n log n) on average. Worst case: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Space complexity: O(log n)

### Heap

Heap sort is a sorting algorithm that works by constructing a binary heap from the input array, repeatedly extracting the maximum element from the heap and inserting it into the sorted portion of the array.

* Time complexity: O(n log n)
* Space complexity: O(1)

### Bogo (for jokes)
Bogo sort is a joke sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly shuffling the input array until it is sorted.

* Time complexity: O((n+1)!) on average. Worst case: O(infinity)
* Space complexity: O(1)
